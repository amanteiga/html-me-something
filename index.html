    <h1>World Pediatric Project: Heal a Child, Change the World</h1>
    <p class="intro">For three years, I have worked at 
        World Pediatric Project (WPP), a registered non-profit in St. Louis that helps children from Central America 
        and the Eastern Caribbean access urgently needed surgical care. Here are a couple of children who have 
    inspired me.* </p>

    <h2 id="myHeader"> Cailyn</h2>
    <p></p><img src="Cailyn.jpg" alt="Cailyn in a brace standing" width="200" height="300">
        Cailyn, age 11 from Belize, suffered a traumatic leg fracture in a serious car accident.  
         After 3 months in the hospital battling infections her leg still would not heal, and local
         doctors said they may need to amputate her leg.  Her mom reached out to WPP and after seven 
         months of treatment in St. Louis, &nbsp;Missouri, Cailyn returned home walking on her own two strong legs!</p>

    <h2 id="myHeader">Iker</h2>
    <img src="Iker.jpg" alt="Iker playing with balloon" width="200" height="200">
    <p>Not even two years old, little Iker from Honduras travelled to St. Louis, &nbsp;Missouri to receive surgery for a 
        congenital heart defect. His only complaint after surgery: his feet hurt from running around so much â€¦ 
        the first time in his life he had the energy to be so active! </p>

    <article>
    <h2 id="myHeader">Kevon</h2>
    <img src="Kevon.png" alt="Kevon healing progress" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Kevon just completed his 17th birthday in St. Louis, &nbsp;Missouri where he has been for almost the last year. He comes
        to us from Barbados with a very rare congenital orthopedic condition that inhibited his ability to walk and eventually
        would have left him permanently disabled. Though his treatment has been long and at times very difficult, 
        he has exhibited extraordinary strength and resilience.
